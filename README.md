# Decoding Health Patterns with Advanced Neural Networks for Stroke Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to unravel insights into stroke prediction by employing a multi-faceted approach, including data exploration, cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, label encoding, feature scaling, and model building using advanced artificial neural networks (ANN). The process culminates in the evaluation of the model's performance through ROC curve analysis and ROC AUC scores. This comprehensive guide offers detailed information on each step of the project, ensuring ease of understanding and implementation.

## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained from Kaggle. It provides valuable information for stroke prediction, including various features related to individuals' health. The dataset was employed for data exploration, cleaning, and analysis to develop an advanced neural network model for predicting stroke risk.
